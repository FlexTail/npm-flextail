# FlexTail

**FlexTail** is a super modern, highly flexible UI component library built for **React** and powered completely by **Tailwind CSS**. Our main goal? To give you simple, ready-to-use pieces that are easy to customize and look great right out of the box\! We've made sure everything supports **dark/light themes** automatically, works perfectly with **TypeScript**, and is built with top-notch **accessibility (A11Y)** so everyone can use your apps.

## 🌐 Wanna See It in Action?

The best place to see how FlexTail works is on our website. You'll find all the **API details**, live **examples**, and a sandbox where you can play around with every setting. Seriously, check it out first\!

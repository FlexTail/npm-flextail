# FlexTail

**FlexTail** is a super modern, highly flexible UI component library built for **React** and powered completely by **Tailwind CSS**. Our main goal? To give you simple, ready-to-use pieces that are easy to customize and look great right out of the box\! We've made sure everything supports **dark/light themes** automatically, works perfectly with **TypeScript**, and is built with top-notch **accessibility (A11Y)** so everyone can use your apps.

## üåê Wanna See It in Action?

The best place to see how FlexTail works is on our website. You'll find all the **API details**, live **examples**, and a sandbox where you can play around with every setting. Seriously, check it out first\!

## üì¶ What's in the Box?

For this first version, we're focusing on core elements:

- **`Button`:** This is your primary action component. It‚Äôs flexible with lots of **colors**, **sizes**, and **shapes**. Need a 'primary' button, or a light 'ghost' one? We've got you covered. Plus, it handles the **loading state** for you and automatically adds the right icon (like a `+` for "add" type) if you don't provide one\!

- **`ButtonGroup`:** This is a neat tool for putting buttons next to each other, like in a toolbar. It automatically cleans up the corners and adds subtle dividers so they look like one continuous unit.

- **TypeScript Types:** Everything is fully typed, so your code editor will love you\! No more guessing props‚Äîintellisense handles it all.

### What's Next?

We're already planning to add essential form elements like `Input`, `Select`, and `Switch` very soon\!
